ARK resolver servlet.



## Definitions

``{ARK}`` format: `"ark:"` `{NAAN}` `"/"` [`{shoulder}`] `{blade}` `{checksum}`

* `{blade}` has an associated `{blade-length}` and `{alphabet}`
* `{checksum}` has an associated `{checksum-algorithm}`
* `{shoulder}` is optional
* `{shoulder}` format:
  one or more alpha (from `{alphabet}`) followed
  by exactly one numeric (from `{alphabet}`)

Once an `{ARK}` has been minted with a `{shoulder}`, there is no indication that
the shoulder is actually a shoulder, versus just a random string of characters.
Then we refer to the resulting [`{shoulder}`]`{blade}` as `{shoulder-blade}`.

`{URL}` is a URL.

`{datastore}` is a database, such as a SQL relational database.

`{checksum-algorithm}` takes as input a `{NAAN}`, `{shoulder-blade}`, and
`{alphabet}`; and returns `{checksum}` (a single character from `{alphabet}`).

`{alphabet}` is an ordered list of alphanumeric characters.

## Actions

#### Resolve
* Given a valid `{ARK}`, find (the single, if any) associated `{URL}` in the `{datastore}`.

#### Find
* Given a `{URL}`, find (any or all) associated (valid) `{ARK}`'s in the `{datastore}`.

#### Mint
* Given a `{URL}`, generate a valid, random, unique `{ARK}` (given: `{NAAN}`,
  `{shoulder}`, `{alphabet}`, `{blade-length}`, and `{checksum-algorithm}`),
  and store them (linked together) in the `{datastore}`.

#### Parse
* Given an arbitrary string, verify it is in correct `{ARK}` format,
  and get its `{NAAN}`, `{shoulder-blade}`, and `{checksum}`.

#### Validate
* Given an `{ARK}` verify its `{checksum}` (using its associated `{alphabet}` and `{checksum-algorithm}`).



## Notes

Parsing, analyzing, or changing `{URL}`'s is out of scope.

Recommended `{alphabet}`: `bcdfghjkmnpqrstvwxz23456789`

Trivial SQL datastore:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Ark (
    ark VARCHAR(256),
    url VARCHAR(2048)
)
```

where:
* `ark` is the `{ARK}` (including the `ark:` label, therefore being a "Compact ARK"),
* `url` is the `{URL}`.

Complete representation would also need these pieces of information,
which would apply to a set of Ark rows:

* Which `{checksum-algorithm}` was used to generate the `{checksum}`'s.
* The `{alphabet}` used in minting the `{ARK}`'s.
